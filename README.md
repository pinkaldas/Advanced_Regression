## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties 
to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Conclusions
Optimum value of Lambda for Ridge Regression = 20
Optimum value of Lambda for Lasso Regression = 150
Lasso Regression gives a simpler model with only 106 features to predict the house price.
Training set: R2 score for Ridge Regression = 0.8600694380834354 and R2 Score for Lasso Regression = 0.8846434917583026
Test Set: R2 score for Ridge Regression = 0.8388173470547214 and R2 score for Lasso Regression = 0.8699388498205985
